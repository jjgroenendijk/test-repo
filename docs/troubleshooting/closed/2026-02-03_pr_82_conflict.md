# PR #82 Merge Conflict Resolution

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Status**: Closed
**PR**: #82

## Issue
A merge conflict was reported for PR #82 "build(deps): bump next from 16.1.4 to 16.1.6 in /website".

## Investigation
- Checked the files in `main` branch (`website/package.json` and `website/package-lock.json`).
- Confirmed that `next` is already at version `16.1.6`.
- Checked the status of PR #82 using `gh pr view 82`.
- Found that PR #82 was already merged on 2026-01-29 by `app/github-actions`.

## Resolution
- Validated that the changes are present in the codebase.
- No further action is required as the PR is already merged and the dependency is updated.
- The reported merge conflict was likely a stale status or misunderstanding of the PR state.
