# Display Storage Usage

## What
Display the total disk usage of the downloads directory on the dashboard. This should include all files within the configured downloads directory, recursively.

## Why
Users need to know how much disk space is being consumed by downloaded videos and archives to manage their storage effectively, especially when running on limited disk space or shared volumes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The dashboard displays the total size of the downloads folder.
- The size is formatted in human-readable units (e.g., KB, MB, GB).
- The value updates when the page is refreshed or history is reloaded.
