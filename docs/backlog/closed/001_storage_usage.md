# Display Storage Usage in Dashboard

## What
Add a "Storage Usage" metric to the "Archive Snapshot" section of the Downloader Dashboard. This should display the total size of the `downloads` directory in a human-readable format (e.g., "1.2 GB").

## Why
Users need to know how much disk space their downloads are consuming to manage the storage volume effectively, especially since the application runs in a container with potentially limited persistent storage.
