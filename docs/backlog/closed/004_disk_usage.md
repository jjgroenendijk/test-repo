# Display Disk Usage

## What
Show the total disk usage of the `downloads` directory in the dashboard.

## Why
Users need to know how much storage space is being used by their archived videos and audio files. This helps in managing storage and preventing the disk from filling up.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Calculate total size of the `downloads` directory.
- [ ] Display the size in a human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB) in the Archive Snapshot panel.
- [ ] Update the usage information when the page loads or when a download completes.
