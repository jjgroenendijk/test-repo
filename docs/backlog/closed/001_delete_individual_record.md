# Delete Individual Download Records

## What
Allow users to delete individual download records from the history list. This action should also remove the associated downloaded files from the disk.

## Why
Currently, users can only clear the entire history. This is inconvenient if they want to remove a single failed download or free up space by deleting specific large files while keeping others.
